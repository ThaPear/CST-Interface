Example

Supported result items

The ASCII data export functionality is available for the following result items:

1D signals

1D and 2D/3D farfields

2D/3D field results

Methods

Reset

Resets the export options to the default.

 

FileName ( filename filename )

Sets the name of the exported file.

 

Mode ( enum type )

Use a fixed step width or a fixed number of samples for your data export. This settings are only available for 2D/3D field results.

 

type can have one of  the following values:

"FixedNumber"

Fixed number of samples

"FixedWidth"

Fixed step width

 

SetfileType(enum type)

Set the file format for exports. This setting is only available for 2D/3D field results.

 

type can have one of  the following values:

"ascii"

ASCII format (default)

"csv"

csv format

"bix"

binary format

 

SetCsvSeparator(string val)

Set the separator for "csv"-formats. This settings is only available for 2D/3D field results.

 

ExportCoordinatesInMeter(bool val)

if "val" is true, then the coordinates  will be exported in meter else in project unit.  This setting is only available for 2D/3D field results.

 

Step ( int steps / double stepwidth )

Number of steps or step width in all directions. Use the .Mode method to select the step definition. This setting is only available for 2D/3D field results.

 

StepX ( int steps / double stepwidth )

StepY ( int steps / double stepwidth )

StepZ ( int steps / double stepwidth )

Number of steps or step width in x / y / z-direction. Use the .Mode method to select the step definition. This settings are only available for 2D/3D field results.

 

SetPointFile(filename name)

Set the file name of a file containing points that are used for the field evaluation and export.

 

 SetSubvolume( double xmin, doublexmax, double ymin, double ymax, double zmin, double zmax );

       Define axis aligned sub volume for the volume exports. This setting is only available for 2D/3D field results.

 

UseSubvolume( bool val )

        Activate or deactivate defined sub volume defined with the ".SetSubvolume" method..

 

SetTimeRange( double val_min, double val_max)

        Set the time range for time dependent results. Times are expected in project units. This setting is only available for 2D/3D field results.

 

SetSampleRange( int val_min, int val_max )

        Set the time sample range for time dependent results.  This setting is only available for 2D/3D field results.

 

 

Execute

Performs the ASCIIExport.

Default Settings

FileName ("")

Mode ("FixedWidth")

Step (-1)

File type  "ascii"

Example

' The following script exports a file containing the electric field  "e1" (if available)

' The file will show 9 columns:

'     3 for the positions (x, y, z) and

'     6 for the electric field vector (3 x Re/Im)

 

' Select the desired monitor in the tree.

SelectTreeItem ("2D/3D Results\E-Field\e1")

 

With ASCIIExport

    .Reset

    .Mode ("FixedNumber")

    .StepX (12)

    .StepY (12)

    .StepZ (8)

    .Execute

End With
