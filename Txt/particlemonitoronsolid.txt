ParticleMonitorOnSolid Object
Defines a particle monitor which collects information about particles colliding with the solid.

Methods

Default Settings

Examples

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Name ( name name )

Defines a name for the particle monitor. This must be consistent with the names of the model components. For the background, there are two special names: "[Background]:Boundary" and "[Background]:Material. "[Background]:Boundary" represents the bounding box defining the PIC calculation domain and "[Background]:Material" represents the interface between the background material and the rest of the structure.

 

EnableCollisionInfo ( bool enable )

Enables the monitoring of collision info: current vs time, power vs time and/or energy histogram.

 

EnableCurrent ( bool enable )

Enables the monitoring of the particle current as a function of time. The solver time step is used for the x-axis step.

 

EnablePower ( bool enable )

Enables the monitoring of the particle power as a function of time. The solver time step is used for the x-axis step.

 

EnableEnergyHistogram ( bool enable )

Enables the monitoring of the number of particles as a function of energy.

 

EnergyBinSize ( double  val)

Sets the energy bin size of the histogram.

 

EnergyMin ( double  val)

Sets the lower energy bound of the histogram.

 

EnergyMax ( double  val)

Sets the upper energy bound of the histogram.

 

Create

Creates a monitor using the settings specified with the previous methods and the default settings.

 

Delete( name name )

Deletes the monitor with the specified name.
