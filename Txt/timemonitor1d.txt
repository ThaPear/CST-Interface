TimeMonitor1D Object

Defines a functional monitor which evaluates a field along a specified chain of edges or curves.

Examples

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal values to their default settings.

 

Name ( name monitorName )

Sets the name of the monitor.

 

Rename ( name oldName, name newName )

Renames the monitor named oldName to newName.

 

Delete ( name monitorName )

Deletes the monitor named monitorName.

 

Create

Creates the monitor with the previously applied settings.

 

FieldType ( enum fType )

Sets what field is to be monitored.

  

fType can have one of the following values:

”voltage”   The voltage along the prescribed path will be monitored.

 

UsePickedEdges ( bool bFlag )

If bFlag is True the previously picked edges will be used for monitoring. To define a valid monitor, these edges have to be connected and must not be self-intersecting.

 

UsePickedEdgeFromId ( string shapeName, int edge_id , int  vertex_id )

For consistency reasons you need to specify the edges to be used by a solid to which it belongs (shapeName), and identification number of the edge (edge_id) and the id of its start vertex (vertex_id). These values can be obtained from the Pick Object command PickEdgeFromId.

 

UseSelectedCurves ( bool bFlag )

If bFlag is True the specified curve items will be used for monitoring. To define a valid monitor, these curves have to be connected and must not be self-intersecting.

 

UseCurve ( string curveitemName )

Defines a curve to be used by the monitor, where curveitemName is the name of a previously defined curve item.

 

InvertOrientation ( bool bFlag )

The orientation of the first edge or curve in a chain specifies a direction which influences the result when the monitor is evaluated along this chain. If bFlag is True, this orientation (direction) is inverted.

Default Settings

UsePickedEdge (False)

UseSelectedCurves (False)

InvertOrientation (False)
