Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings.

 

Name ( name objectname )

Sets the name of the extrude Object.

 

Component ( name componentname )

Sets the component for the new Solid. The component must already exist.

 

Material ( name materialname )

Sets the material for the new Solid. The material must already exist.

 

Mode ( enum extrMode )

Selects whether a profile or a surface is to be extruded.

extrMode may have the following settings:

”pointlist”

A profile defined by points is to be extruded

”picks”

A picked face is to be extruded

"multiplepicks"

multpile picked faces are to be extruded

 

Height ( string heightval )

Defines the height of the extruded solid.

 

Origin (  double x , double y, double z )

Defines the location of the origin.

 

Uvector ( double u, double v, double w )

Vvector ( double u , double v, double w )

These settings define the plane on which the profile will be defined. u, v, w are related on the current working coordinate system.

 

Point ( double uPt, double vPt )

Sets the first point of the to be defined profile. This setting has an effect only if Mode is set to ”pointlist”.

 

LineTo ( double u, double v )

Sets a line from the point previously defined to the point defined by u, v here. u and v specify a location in absolute coordinates in the actual working coordinate system. This line will be a part of the profile to be rotated/extruded. To finisch a profile, the last line has to end on the values defined by the Point Method. This setting has an effect only, if Mode  is set to ”pointlist”.

 

RLine ( double u, double v )

Sets a line from the point previously defined to the point defined by u, v here. u and v specify a location relative to the previous point in the current working coordinate sytem. This line will be a part of the profile to be rotated/extruded. To finisch a profile, the last line has to end on the values defined by the Point Method. This setting has an effect only, if Mode is set to ”pointlist”.

 

Taper ( double tp )

Defines a value of how much the to be extruded face is enlarged during extrusion.

 

Twist ( double tw )

Twists the solid around the direction of extrusion. The parameter tw defines the angle in degree of how much the solid will be twisted.

 

UsePicksForHeight ( bool flag )

Use a previously picked point for the height of the extrusion.

 

PickHeightDeterminedByFirstFace( bool flag )

For multiple picked faces and a picked point that is used for calculating the height: If true, the height that is calculated for the first picked face will be applied to all created shapes. If false, for each picked face, the height will be calculated to meet the picked point.

 

NumberOfPickedFaces( int nCount )

If the mode is "multiplepicks", the number of picked faces is set here.

 

DeleteBaseFaceSolid ( bool flag )

Deletes the face used for the extrusion.

 

ClearPickedFace ( bool flag )

Cleares the picked face after the extrude command.

 

ModifyHeight

Changes the solid to the previously specified settings.

 

SetSimplifyActive ( bool switch )

Set this option to enable the polygon simplification.

 

SetSimplifyMinPointsArc ( int nCount )

Minimum number of segments needed to recognize an arc. Must be >= 3.

 

SetSimplifyMinPointsCircle ( int nCount )

Minimum number of segments needed for complete circles. Must be > 'SetSimplifyMinPointsArc' and at least 5.

 

SetSimplifyAngle ( double angle )

The maximum angle in degrees between two adjacent segments. All smaller angles will be considered to be simplified. The angle is only used for arcs and not for circles.

 

SetSimplifyAdjacentTol ( double angle )

Is only used by the simplification algorithm to find a good starting point for arcs. It means the maximum angular difference in the angle of adjacent segments. A good value for this parameter will be 1.0.

 

SetSimplifyRadiusTol ( double deviation )

This means the maximum deviation in percent the distance a segment end point can have to the current definition of the simplification circle center point. The tolerance is used for circles and arcs.

 

SetSimplifyAngleTang ( double angle )

Maximum angular tolerance in radians used when deciding to create the arc tangential or not to its adjacent line segments. If an angle is beneath the specified value, the arc is build tangential to the neighbor edge.

 

SetSimplifyEdgeLength ( double length )

Edges smaller than the defined length will be removed. Can be used to remove tiny fragments.

Creates a new extruded solid. All necessary settings for this element have to be made previously.
