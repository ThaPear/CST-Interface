VectorPlot2D Object

This object allows to plot three dimensional vector fields in a cutting plane. Therefore the 3D Fields on 2D Plane option has to be active. To choose what field to plot the SelectTreeItem command can be used.

General Methods

Color ( bool switch )

Plots the arrows relating to their values in different colors.

 

Arrows ( int arrows )

Defines the number of arrows used for the field plot.

 

dBScale ( bool switch )

Decides whether the fields should be plotted in a dB scale or not.

 

dBUnit ( int unit )

Sets the a unit for logarithmic farfield plots. The unit must be integer and between "0" and "4". ("0" = "3D Max = 0 dB", "1" = "2D Max = 0 dB",

"2" = "dBV/m", "3" = "dBmV/m", "4" = "dBuV/m").

 

dBRange ( double range )

Sets the logarithmic field plot range in dB.

Please note: range must be a double value here. Any expression is not allowed.

 

LogScale ( bool switch )

Decides whether the fields should be plotted in a logarithmical scale or not.

 

LogStrength ( double strength )

The characteristic curve used for logarithmic scaling can be varied. Values from 1.0e-6 to 100000 are allowed.

 

Plot

Plots the field with the previously made settings.

 

Default Settings

Example

The following script plots the electric field  "e1" (if available) in a linear scale by using arrows with density equal 30% . The y-z-plane is defined as cutting plane.

 

' Plot only a wire frame of the structure to be able to look inside

Plot.wireframe (True)

 

' Select the desired monitor in the tree.

SelectTreeItem ("2D/3D Results\E-Field\e1")

 

' Enables plotting of 3D fields on 2D planes

Plot3DPlotsOn2DPlane (True)

 

' Plot the field of the selected monitor

With VectorPlot2D

    .SetDensityInPercent(30)

    .ArrowSize (50)

    .PlaneNormal ("x")

    .PlaneCoordinate (0.0)

    .LogScale (False)

End With
