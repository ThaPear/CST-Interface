ParticleBeam Object

This Object is used to define a particle beam source for the wakefield-solver.

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Delete (name  name)

Deletes the specified particle-beam source.

 

Rename (name  oldname, name  newname )

Renames the specified particle-beam.

 

Name (name  name )

Sets the name of the new particle-beam source.

 

IsBunchGaussian(bool flag)

Sets the beam shape to a gaussian excitation.

 

ExcitationSignal(string  name )

Sets the name of the excitation signal, which should be of type ASCII-import or User-defined.

 

Length (double  value)

Sets the standard deviation (sigma) of the Gaussian shaped particle bunch.

 

Beta (double  value)

Sets the velocity of the particle bunch.

 

Charge (double  value)

Sets  the total charge of the particle bunch

 

ConsiderForMeshRefinement (bool  flag)

Determines if the bunch settings should affect the mesh generation or not. It is strongly recommended to set this value to "True".

 

LinesPerSigma (bool flag, double lines)

Allows to specify a longitudinal mesh refinement for particle beams. In case numerical dispersion plays an important role it is possible to refine the mesh with this setting only in direction of beam propagation.

 

BeamPoint  (bool  pickpoint, double  xcoord, double  ycoord, double  zcoord)

Define one point on the beam axis by choosing the last pickpoint (set pickpoint to "True") or by defining the coordinates numerically.

 

BeamDir (double xdir, double ydir, double zdir)

Define the beam axis direction numerically. The beam axis must be parallel to a main coordinate axis x,y or z.

 

IndirectWakeIntegration (bool flag)

Determines if the indirect integration should be used (more accurate) or not. If it is not possible to compute wakepotentials with the indirect method, the direct integration will be used.

 

WakeIntegrationShift (double xshift, double yshift, double zshift)

The wake integration axis, where the wake potential is calculated can be shifted to the particle beam axis, in order to compute wakefields for particles which are "off-axis". Ony two of three values are taken into account, since the wake-axis is shifted only transversal.

 

Create

Creates the source with the previously made settings.
