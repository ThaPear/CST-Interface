TimeMonitor0D Object

Defines a functional monitor which evaluates a field at a specified point.  

Methods

Default Settings

Examples

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal values to their default settings.

 

Name ( name monitorName )

Sets the name of the monitor.

 

Rename ( name oldName, name newName )

Renames the monitor named oldName to newName.

 

Delete ( name monitorName )

Deletes the monitor named monitorName.

 

Create

Creates the monitor with the previously applied settings.

 

FieldType ( enum fType )

Sets what field is to be monitored.

 

fType can have one of the following values:

”B-Field”               The magnetic flux density will be monitored.

"H-Field"               The magnetic field strength will be monitored.

"E-Field"               The electric field will be monitored.

"Cond. Current Dens."   The conduction current density will be monitored.

"Material"              The the relative permeability of the material at the given position will be monitored.

”Temperature”           The temperature will be monitored.

 

Component ( enum comp )

Sets the component of the specified field to be monitored.

comp can have one of the following values: X, Y, Z, Abs.

 

UsePickedPoint ( bool bFlag )

If bFlag is True the previously picked point will be used for monitoring, and CoordinateSystem and Position settings will be ignored.

 

Position ( double posX, double posY, double posZ )

Sets the position of the point in which the specified field is to be monitored.

Default Settings

Component (X)

UsePickedPoint (False)

CoordinateSystem (Cartesian)

Position (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

Examples

' creates a time domain magnetic field monitor at the origin
