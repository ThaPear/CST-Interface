ScalarPlot2D Object

This object allows to plot three dimensional vector fields on a cutting plane. Therefore the 3D Fields on 2D Plane option has to be active. To choose what field to plot, the SelectTreeItem command can be used.

General Methods

Scaling ( int scale )

Defines a scale factor of the plotted objects. A value between 0 and 100 may be given. This value influences the size of the objects.

 

dBScale ( bool switch )

Decides whether the fields should be plotted in a dB scale or not.

 

dBUnit ( int unit )

Sets the a unit for logarithmic farfield plots. The unit must be integer and between "0" and "4". ("0" = "3D Max = 0 dB", "1" = "2D Max = 0 dB",

"2" = "dBV/m", "3" = "dBmV/m", "4" = "dBuV/m").

 

dBRange ( double range )

Sets the logarithmic field plot range in dB.

Please note: range must be a double value here. Any expression is not allowed.

 

LogScale ( bool switch )

Decides whether the fields should be plotted in a logarithmical scale or not.

 

LogStrength ( double strength )

The characteristic curve used for logarithmic scaling can be varied. Values from 1.0e-6 to 100000 are allowed.

 

ScaleToVectorMaximum ( bool switch )

All components will be scaled to the vector maximum. Thus different components can be compared. If not enabled, the components are scaled to their own maximum.

 

ScaleToRange ( bool switch )

Scales the plot to a range given by ScaleRange. (The used color ramp represents the values between the given interval) This is useful to compare plots with different maximum values.

 

ScaleRange ( double min, double max )

Sets the minimal and maximal values of the plot. This setting has only an effect, if ScaleToRange is True.

 

Plot

Plots the field with the previously made settings.
