FluidDomain Object
This object is used to specify a domain (cavity) for a (not explicitly modeled) fluid for the Conjugate Heat Transfer Solver.

If a fluid domain is not closed, each open part must be closed by a lid.

Methods

Example

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings of the fluid domain to their default values.

 

Name ( string name )

Specifies the name of the fluid domain. Each fluid domain must have a unique name.

 

CavityMaterial ( string materialname )

Specifies the material of fluid inside the fluid domain. The materialname should be a name of a material that exists in the active project.

 

AddFace ( solidname solidname, int faceid  )

Defines a face inside the fluid domain cavity. For a complex cavities, consisting of multiple connected solids, it is sufficient to specify only one interior face.

In order to define multiple disjoint domains with the same properties, multiple faces can be defined.
Each face describing the fluid domain must be specified by its faceid of the solid with name solidname.

 

InvertNormal ( bool flag )

Usually, the fluid domain is considered the domain into which the normal vector of the picked face is pointing. In general, this is the background material side of the face.

In order to change this direction, i.e. the side of the picked face, the flag should be set True.

default: value = False

 

Create

Creates the fluid domain with its previously made settings.

 

Delete ( string name )

Deletes the fluid domain with the given name.

 

Rename  ( string oldname,  string newname  )

Renames the fluid domain with the given oldname to the defined newname.

Example

With FluidDomain

     .Reset

     .CavityMaterial "Water"

     .AddFace "component1:pipe", "352"

     .InvertNormal "False"

     .Create
