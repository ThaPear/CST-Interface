TraceFromCurve Object

This object is used to create a new shape from a curve item. You can cover a previously defined curve item (closed or open) with arbitrary thickness and width. After that operation the curve item will not exist any longer.

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Name ( name solidname )

Sets the name of the new solid.

 

Component ( name componentname  )

Sets the name of the component for the new solid. The component must already exist.

 

Material ( name materialname )

Sets the material name for the new solid. The material must already exist.

 

Curve ( name curvename )

The name of the curve item the new solid should be created. The correct format for the name should be 'curvename:curveitemname' (see the example below). If the curve item (e.g. a line) is connected with an other curve item (e.g. a polygon) both curve items will be transformed into the new solid.

 

Thickness ( double thicknessvalue )

Sets the thickness of the trace. The thickness is along the z-axis in the global coordinate system and along the w-axis in the local coordinate system. Negative thickness settings will result in an extrusion into the opposite direction.

 

Width ( double widthvalue )

Sets the width of the trace. The width is perpendicular to the thickness.

 

RoundStart ( bool makestartround )

Specifies if the first end of the new solid should be drawn rounded or not. Constraint: the curve must be open, otherwise this flag will be ignored.

 

RoundEnd ( bool makeendround )

Specifies if the second end of the new solid should be drawn rounded or not. Constraint: the curve must be open, otherwise this flag will be ignored.

 

GapType ( int type )

Specifies the behavior of the creating solid on inflexion points of the curve. Possible values: 0 = rounded like arcs, 1 = extended like lines and 2 = natural like curve extensions.

 

Create

Creates a new solid. All necessary settings for this solid have to be made previously.
