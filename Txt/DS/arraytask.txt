Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Name ( name taskname )

Sets the name of a phased array antenna task before calling Create.

 

SetExcitationPattern (string pattern)

Sets the excitation pattern for the phased array antenna. Valid choices are: Uniform, Cosine, Cosine-Sq., Taylor, Binomial and Chebyshev

 

SetShapeCustom (int elements_in_x, int elements_in_y, double spacing_in_x, double spacing_in_y, double grid_angle)

Sets the settings for creating a custom shape phased array antenna

elements_in_x: Specify the number of elements in the X direction.

elements_in_y: Specify the number of elements in the Y direction.

spacing_in_x: Specify the spacing in the X direction. This is the distance from an element's center to the center of an adjacent element in the X direction.

spacing_in_y: Specify the spacing in the Y direction. This is the distance from an element's center to the center of an adjacent element in the Y direction.

grid_angle: Specify the grid angle of the array.

 

SetShapeDiamond (int elements_in_a_side, double spacing_in_x, double spacing_in_y)

Sets the settings for creating a diamond shape phased array antenna

elements_in_a_side: Specify the number of elements in one side of the diamond.

spacing_in_x: Specify the spacing in the X direction. This is the distance from an element's center to the center of an adjacent element in the X direction.

spacing_in_y: Specify the spacing in the Y direction. This is the distance from an element's center to the center of an adjacent element in the Y direction.

 

SetShapeHexagonal (int elements_in_a_side, double spacing_in_x, double spacing_in_y)

Sets the settings for creating a hexagonal shape phased array antenna

elements_in_a_side: Specify the number of elements in one side of the hexagon.

spacing_in_x: Specify the spacing in the X direction. This is the distance from an element's center to the center of an adjacent element in the X direction.

spacing_in_y: Specify the spacing in the Y direction. This is the distance from an element's center to the center of an adjacent element in the Y direction.

 

SetShapeOctagonal (int elements_in_a_side, double spacing_in_x, double spacing_in_y)

Sets the settings for creating a octagonal shape phased array antenna

elements_in_a_side: Specify the number of elements in one side of the octagon.

spacing_in_x: Specify the spacing in the X direction. This is the distance from an element's center to the center of an adjacent element in the X direction.

spacing_in_y: Specify the spacing in the Y direction. This is the distance from an element's center to the center of an adjacent element in the Y direction.

 

Create

Creates a new phased array antenna task.

Example

'Delete the task if it exists

 

With SimulationTask

.Reset

.Name ("Task1")

If .doesexist Then .delete

End With

 

'Create a new phased array antenna task

 

With PhasedArrayTask

.Reset

.Name ("Task1")    

.SetShapeCustom ("5", "5", "10.0", "10.0", "63.43")

.SetExcitationPattern ("Cosine")

.Create

End With
