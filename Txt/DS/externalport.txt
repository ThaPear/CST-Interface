General Methods

Create

Creates a new external port.

 

Delete

Deletes the currently selected external port.

 

DoesExist bool

Checks if an external port with the currently selected number already exists.

 

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

%% Identification

 

Name ( name portname )

Sets the name of an external port before calling Create. Furthermore, this method can be used to select an existing external port of your model. The name must either be an integer number or of the form "n(m)", where n is the integer number of the port and m is the mode index. The latter form is used for higher order mode ports.

 

Number ( int portnumber )

Sets the number of an external port before calling Create. Furthermore, this method can be used to select an existing external port of your model.

 

%% Getter

 

GetNumber int

Returns the external port's number.

 

%% Setter

 

SetName ( name portname )

Modifies the name of an existing external port. The name must either be an integer number or of the form "n(m)", where n is the integer number of the port and m is the mode index. The latter form is used for higher order mode ports.

 

SetNumber ( int portnumber )

Modifies the number of an existing external port.

 

SetHigherOrderMode ( bool higher, int mode )

Switches on/off the higher order mode naming convention for an external port.

 

SetImpedanceType ( string type )

Sets the external port's impedance type. This setting must be called for already existing ports.

type = 0

block dependent

type = 1

fixed value

type = 2

file dependent

 

 

SetImpedance ( double value )

Sets a value to the port's  fixed real impedance property. Call "SetImpedanceType(1)" to use this impedance in the simulation. This setting must be called for already existing ports.

 

SetComplexImpedance ( double re, double im )

Sets the real and the imaginary values to the port's  fixed complex impedance property. Call "SetImpedanceType(1)" to use this impedance in the simulation. This setting must be called for already existing ports.

 

SetImpedanceFileName ( string filename  )

Sets the file name of a "s1p" touchstone file, specifying a frequency dependent port impedance. The file may contain either impedances, admittances or reflection coefficients. Call "SetImpedanceType(2)" to use this impedance in the simulation. This setting must be called for already existing ports.

 

SetLocalUnitForImpedance ( string unit )

Sets the given impedance unit for the external port's impedance, i.e. the impedance's value will not refer to the project's global unit any more but to this local unit.

 

SetGlobalUnitForImpedance

Sets the global impedance unit for the external port's impedance.

 

SetDifferential ( bool differential )

Makes the external port a differential port, i.e. its reference pin can be accessed.

 

%% Iteration

 

StartPortNameIteration int

Resets the iterator for external ports and returns the number of external ports.

 

GetNextPortName name

Returns the next external port's name. Call StartPortNameIteration before the first call of this method.

 

%% Positioning

 

Position ( int x, int y )

Specifies the position of the external port. This setting must be made before calling Create. Furthermore, it can be used to modify an external port's position. Possible values are 0 < x, y <100000, i.e. (50000, 50000) is the center of the schematic. It is always ensured that the external port is aligned with the grid, therefore the specified position might get adjusted slightly.

 

Rotate ( int angle )

Rotates the external port by the given angle in degrees around its center point. If this setting is made before calling Create, the angle is only stored. The rotation will then be done in Create.

 

Move ( int x, int y )

Moves an external port by the given offset. Note that the schematic size is given by 0 < x, y <100000. Use Position to specify a certain location. It is always ensured that the external port is aligned with the grid, therefore the specified offset might get adjusted slightly.

Default Settings

Position (50000, 50000)

Examples

'Create an external port

 

With ExternalPort

.Reset

.Number (1)

.Position(50000, 50000)

.Create

.SetImpedanceType 1 ' Set fixed impedance

.SetImpedance 50

End With

 

'Modify an existing external port's position

 

With ExternalPort

.Reset

.Number (1)

.Position(57000, 50500) ' Move to absolute position (57000, 50500)

.Move(7000, 500) ' Move by offset (7000, 500) relative to old position

End With
