All blocks that are associated with a 3D CST STUDIO SUITE project offer access to the 3D related VBA commands via the block object: You can e.g. access the brick object of a CST MICROWAVE STUDIO block via Block.Brick. However, this mechanism requires that the corresponding project is opened when the block name is set. This can be disturbing, so if you know that you will not need any 3D related VBA command, you can call EnableSlaveCommands(false) before calling Name(), and then the project will not be opened, and the 3D VBA commands will not be available.

 

%% Iteration

 

StartBlockNameIteration int

Resets the iterator for the blocks and returns the number of blocks.

Moves a block by the given offset. Note that the schematic size is given by 0 < x, y <100000. Use Position to specify a certain location. It is always ensured that the block is aligned with the grid, therefore the specified offset might get adjusted slightly. This setting must not be made before calling Create.

 

Position ( int x, int y )

Specifies the position of the block. This setting must be made before calling Create. Furthermore, it can be used to modify a block's position. Possible values are 0 < x, y <100000, i.e. (50000, 50000) is the center of the schematic. It is always ensured that the block is aligned with the grid, therefore the specified position might get adjusted slightly.

%% Special Methods

 

Convert

For some file or project blocks only.
Converts a file block into a project block or vice versa. For conversion of a project block into a file block a file dialog opens, where you need to specify where the external file will be stored. The file(s) inside the project which were used by the original block will be deleted after conversion. In both cases, the file(s) used by the block will be copied from the old to the new location.

If a library model with the same name and path is already present in the device model library it will be overwritten.

The return value is the tree path in the device model library which can be used together with the SetLibraryModel command.

The method can only be applied to blocks that use Vector Fitting to represent dispersive data. This can be queried by the method CanUseMOR.

 

SetUseNaturalImpedances( bool bFlag )

The flag specifies whether natural port impedances are used as reference for the convolution of a Vector Fitting model, used in transient simulation or, if false, whether a fixed impedance is used as reference impedance for all ports. Natural port impedances are advantageous, because they tend to lead to shorter impulse responses and to a lower number of significant poles. The method can only be applied to blocks that use Vector Fitting to represent dispersive data. This can be queried by the method CanUseMOR().

 

SetMOR_RenormalizationImpedance( double resistance )

Specifies a positive resistance to which all ports impedances are renormalized when S-Parameters are supplied to the Vector Fitting. The argument is in Ohms. Note that the renormalization is only carried out if no natural port impedances are used. This managed by the method SetUseNaturalImpedances. The method can only be applied to blocks that use Vector Fitting to represent dispersive data. This can be queried by the method CanUseMOR.

 

SetConvolutionFmax( double fmax )

Specifies the maximum frequency to which S-Parameters are fitted in Vector Fitting. The argument is in frequency units. If the argument is zero by value, the maximum frequency is calculated automatically, based on the transient excitation. The method can only be applied to blocks that can use convolution via MOR or IFT. This can be queried by the method CanUseMOR.
