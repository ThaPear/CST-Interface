Methods

%% General Methods

Create

Creates a new probe. All necessary settings for this connection have to be made previously.

 

Delete

Deletes a probe. All necessary settings for this connection have to be made previously.

 

DoesExist bool

Checks if a probe with the currently defined properties already exists.

 

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

%% Identification

 

Name ( name probename )

Sets the name of a probe before calling Create. Furthermore, this method can be used to select an existing probe of your model prior of calling queries.

 

LinkName ( name linkname )

Sets the name of a probe link before calling Create. Furthermore, this method can be used to select an existing probe link of your model prior of calling queries.

 

ReferenceLinkName ( name probename )

Sets the name of a reference link of a differential probe before calling Create. Furthermore, this method can be used to select an existing differential probe using its reference link of your model prior of calling queries.

 

%% Getter

 

GetName name

Returns the name of the probe with the currently defined properties.

 

GetLinkName name

Returns the link name of the probe with the currently defined properties.

 

GetReferenceLinkName name

Returns the name of the reference link of the differential probe with the currently defined properties.

 

GetType int

Returns the type of the probe with the currently defined properties. The following int values are returned:

0: No probe

1: normal probe

2: differential probe

 

%% Setter

 

SetName ( name probename )

Modifies the name of an existing probe.

 

SetNodeFromBlockPort ( name blockname, name portname, bool directioninwards, bool referencepin )

Sets the probe's location by the specification of a block's port or its associated reference pin. Furthermore, the probe's direction must be given.

 

%% Iteration

 

StartProbeNameIteration int

Resets the iterator for the probes and returns the number of probes.

 

GetNextProbeName name

Returns the next probe's name. Call StartProbeNameIteration before the first call of this method.

 

%% Positioning

 

GetLabelPositionX int

Returns the horizontal position of the center point of the label of the probe with the currently defined properties.

 

GetLabelPositionY int

Returns the vertical position of the center point of the label of the probe with the currently defined properties.

 

NormalDirection bool

Returns True if the direction of the probe with the currently defined properties is normal.

 

ChangeDirection

Changes a probe's direction, i.e. the current is considered with opposite sign.
