Example

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings of the heat source to their default values.

 

Name ( string name )

Specifies the name of the heat source.

 

Value ( doubleexpression value )

Specifies the heat flow value for the heat source.

 

Type ( enum type )

Selects one of the following types:

"PTC"       Heat source on a perfect thermal conductor.

"Volume"    Homogeneous volume heat source on a solid with normal thermal conductivity

 

ValueType ( enum {"Integral", "Density"} type )

Specify if the volume heat source value is defined as an integral type or a density type.

 

Face ( solidname solidname, int faceid )

A heat source can be defined on several faces. This method adds a face (indicated by its faceid) of a certain solid (indicated by its solidname) to the face list for the heat source.

 

Create

Creates the heat source with its previously made settings.

 

Delete ( string name )

Deletes the heat source with the given name.

 

Rename  ( string oldname,  string newname  )

Renames the heat source with the given oldname to the defined newname.

 

GetValue (name name ) value

Returns the value of a heat source with a given name.

 

GetType (name name ) type

Returns the type ("PTC" or "Volume") of a heat source with a given name.

 

GetValueType (name name ) type

Returns the value type ("Integral" or "Density") of a volume heat source source with a given name.

Default Settings

Name ("")

Value ("")

Face ("", 0)

Type ("PTC")

Example

With HeatSource

     .Reset
