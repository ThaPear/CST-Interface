Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their initial values.

 

SetMonitorType ( enum{"frequency", "time"} monitorType )

Selects between time domain or frequency domain monitors. To combine farfield monitors set the monitor type to "frequency".

 

SetOffsetType ( enum{"time", "phase"} offsetType )

Selects the offset type when combining time domain monitors. This offset may be either a time shift or a phase shift at a given reference frequency.

 

SetReferenceFrequency ( double fRef )

Sets the reference frequency for the phase shift when combining time domain monitor results.

 

EnableAutomaticLabeling ( bool bFlag )

Activates or deactivates the automatic labeling when combining results.

 

SetLabel ( name labelName )

Sets the name for a result combination.

 

SetExcitationValues ( string Type, string Source, int  Mode,  double amplitude, double phase_or_timedelay )

Specifies the amplitude and phase (respectively  time shift value) for a selected excitation. Supported excitations are:

Excitation source

Type

Source

Mode

Waveguide port

"port"

Port number

Mode number

Discrete port

"port"

Port number

not available

Farfield source

"ffs"

Farfield source name

not available

Nearfield source

"cd"

Nearfield source name

not available

 

For the specified excitation the amplitude is set to amplitude and the  phase value (respectively  time shift values) is set to phase_or_timedelay.

 

GetCombinationFromLabel ( name labelName ) string

Returns the combination string for the given label.

 

SetAllExcitations ( double amplitude, double phase_or_timedelay )

For all available excitations the amplitudes are set to amplitude and the phase values (respectively  time shift values) are set to phase_or_timedelay.

 

SetSystemAmplitude ( double amplitude )

The combine results feature may be used to simulate a network excitation. amplitude is the system stimulation amplitude which is equivalent to the excitation defined above.

 

SetSystemBalance ( double balance )

Sets the balance of the total system (i.e. model and exciting circuit).

 

SetNone

Sets the amplitudes and phase values (or time shift values) for all excitations to 0 and resets the system settings. Therefore no combination will be done.

 

ClearFilters

Clears the monitor selection filters. Only native 1D results are combined.

 

AddFilter ( string Filter )

Adds a monitor selection filter to the internal filter set. The following expressions are allowed:

 

Filter

Action

*

All monitors are added to the selection

<MonitorName>

OnlyAtFrequency ( double freq )

Combines all monitors defined the frequency "freq".

 

Run

Starts combining monitor results. The combined results are added to the result tree in the respective sub folders.
