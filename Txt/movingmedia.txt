Methods

 

Reset

Resets all internal settings of the moving media item to their default values.

 

Name ( string name )

Specifies the name of the moving media item.

A moving media item can be defined on several solids. This method adds a face (indicated by its faceid) of a certain solid (indicated by its solidname) to the face list for the moving media item. Actually, the whole solidname is selected.

 

VelocityVector (  doubleexpression x_component, doubleexpression y_component, doubleexpression z_component, enum { "m/s", "km/h" } units )

Defines the velocity vector for the moving media.

 

Create

Creates a new moving media item with its previously made settings.

 

Delete ( string name )

Name ("")

VelocityVector ("0", "0", "0", "m/s")

Example

With MovingMedia

     .Reset

     .Name "translation1"
