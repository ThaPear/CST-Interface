ColorRamp Object
Use this to change the color order for the color-by-value field plots.

Methods

Reset

Resets internal settings to defaults.

 

Type ( enum ramptype )

Sets the color ramp to a predefined color order.

enum ramptype

color order

"Rainbow"

blue-cyan-green-yellow-red (default)

"Fire"

cyan-blue-magenta-red-yellow

"Inspire"

green-blue-magenta-red-yellow

"FarFire"

blue-magenta-red-yellow (for far fields)

"Gray"

for black-and-white printer

"Hot"

black-red-yellow-white

 

Invert ( bool switch )

Inverts the color order, e.g. turn the rainbow type to red-yellow-green-cyan-blue.

 

NumberOfContourValues ( int number )

Changes the number of contour values. The number must be greater 2, numbers greater 99 are not recommended for normal use. A higher value results in a smoother coloring.

 

GetNumberOfContourValues long

Returns the number of contour values.

 

DrawContourLines ( bool switch )

Outline the contour values with black lines between the color steps. Does only apply for 2D / 3D contour plots and 3D farfield plots.

 

SetClampRange( double min, double max )

Sets the min and max value of the "clamp to range" feature. Is ignored for 3D farfield plots.

 

SetScalingMode( enum scalingmode )

Sets the scaling mode.  Is ignored for 3D farfield plots.

enum scalingtype

scaling

"linear"

linear scaling (default)

"log"

logarithmic color scaling

"dbmax"

dB scaling mode with maximum as reference value

"db"

dB scaling mode with 1[unit] as reference value

"dbmilli"

dB scaling mode with 0.001[unit] as reference value

"dbmicro"

dB scaling mode with 1e-6[unit] as reference value

 

SetLogStrength( double strength )

Sets the log strength if the log scaling mode is active. Values from >1.0 to 100000 are allowed.  Is ignored for 3D farfield plots.

 

SetdBRange( double range)

Sets the dB range if a db scaling mode is active.  Is ignored for 3D farfield plots.

 

Style (enum {"None" / "Vertical"} )

This switch either hides (None) the color ramp or positions it vertically in the main view.

Default Settings

Type ("rainbow")

Invert (False)

NumberOfContourValues (33)

DrawContourLines (False)
