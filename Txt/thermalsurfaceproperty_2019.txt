ThermalSurfaceProperty Object
This object offers the possibility to create a thermal surface with its radiation and convection properties. A thermal surface can consist of several different shape faces and is used by the Thermal Solver.

Methods

Coverage (enum type)
Defines the part of the selected surface to which the thermal surface property must be assigned. This setting is used only by the tetrahedral mesh based thermal solver.
type (enum )        meaning
"WholeSurface"      Thermal surface property is assigned to the whole surface excluding parts possessing fixed temperature (temperature source or isothermal boundary)
"BackgroundOnly"    Thermal surface property is assigned only to the parts of the surface directly contracting background, including adiabatic boundaries but exluding symmetry planes and open boundaries without added space.
