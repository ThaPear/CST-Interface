Curve Object

This object is used to apply operations on curves and curve items.

Methods

Example

Methods

NewCurve ( name curvename )

Defines and names a new curve object.

 

DeleteCurve ( name curvename )

Deletes a specified curve object.

 

RenameCurve ( name oldname, name newname )

Renames a specified curve object.

 

DeleteCurveItem ( name curvename, name curveitemname )

Deletes a specified item object associated to a curve object.

 

RenameCurveItem ( name curvename, name oldcurveitemname, name newcurveitemname )

Renames a specified item object associated to a curve object.

 

DeleteCurveItemSegment ( name curvename, name curveitemname, int edgeid )

Deletes a segment of an item object associated to a curve object. The segment is specified by the name of the curve and the item that it belongs as well as an identity number.

 

MoveCurveItem ( name curveitemname, name oldcurvename, name newcurvename )

Moves a specified item from the curve it belongs to another curve object.

 

StartCurveNameIteration ( string type ) long numberofcurves

Start iterating over the curves:

"all"

All curves

"open"

Only the open curves

"closed"

Only the closed curves

 

GetNextCurveName () name nextcurvename

Returns the next curve name. Use StartCurveNameIteration to start the iteration.

 

GetPointCoordinates (string curveitemname,  string pid, double &x,double &y,double &z )  bool

Retrieves the coordinates of the point with the given pid. Returns false if there is no such point.

 

GetNumberOfPoints (string curveitemname ) int

Returns the maximum number of points.

 

IsClosed (string curveitemname ) bool

Returns whether it is a closed curve or not.

Example

Curve.RenameCurve "curve1", "MyCurves"

Curve.DeleteCurveItemSegment "curve1", "rectangle1", "1"
