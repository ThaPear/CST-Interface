ScalarPlot3D Object

This object allows to plot three dimensional complex scalar values. To choose what scalar field to plot the SelectTreeItem command can be used.

General Methods

Type ( enum key )

Selects the type of Plot.

key can have one of  the following values:

"contour"

The field values of the chosen scalar field will be plotted on the surfaces of the structure in different colors.

"isosurfaces"

Surfaces of equal value of the chosen scalar field will be plotted.

"bubbles"

Spheres of color and size depending on field value are plotted on equidistant positions.

 

PlotAmplitude ( bool switch )

If switch is True, the absolute values (the amplitudes) of the complex scalar values are plotted.

 

PhaseValue ( double phase )

Specifies the phase of to be plotted complex field values.

 

PhaseStep ( double step )

Specifies the step width used by phase incrementing actions.

 

Quality ( int quality )

The Plot data for scalar values on surfaces is represented by triangles. This setting influences the number of triangles used for the plot. A fine plot quality will result in a longer plot generation time and thus in slower movies as well. A value between 0 and 100 may be given.

 

SetTime ( double time )

The current time value of a time monitor plot is set.

 

SetSample ( long sample )

The current time sample number of a time monitor plot is set.

 

IsoValue ( double value )

Draw surfaces on which the selected component or absolute value have a specific value.

 

SetComponent ( enum component )

Sets the vector component of a vector result that should be visualized by a Scalar Plot.

component can have one of  the following values:

"x"

The x component of the vector result

"y"

The y component of the vector result

"z"

The z component of the vector result

"abs"

The absolute value of the vector result

"normal"

The normal part of the vector field is the scalar product of the surface’s normal vector and the field vector on the surface.

"tangential"

The tangential part is the absolute value of the difference between the vector and the normal part of the vector.

 

%% Query

 

GetDomain enum

Returns the domain of the monitor used, return code can have the following values:

"frequency"     The plot is based on recordings of a frequency domain monitor.

"time"          The plot is based on recordings of a time domain monitor.

"static"        The plot is based on recordings of a static monitor.

 

GetNumberOfSamples long

Returns the total number of samples if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.

 

GetTStart double

Returns the start time of recording if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.0.

 

GetTEnd double

Returns the end time of recording if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.0.

 

GetTStep double

Returns the time step width of recording if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.0.

 

GetTime double

Returns the current  time set of a time monitor plot.

 

GetSample long

Returns the current time sample number of a time monitor plot.

Example

The following script plots surfaces of equal amplitude of the vector field component Y of the electric field "e1".

 

' Plot only a wire frame of the structure to be able to look inside

Plot.wireframe (True)

 

' Select the Y-Component of the electric field e1 in the tree

SelectTreeItem ("2D/3D Results\E-Field\e1")

SetComponent ("Y")
