SweepCurve Object

This object enables a sweep operation on a curve item. The item will be moved along a specified path represented by another curve item so that a solid structure is created. Constraint: The curve to be swept must be closed and planar. As soon as the new shape is created it will appear in the main plot window and on the Navigation Tree.

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Name ( name solidname )

Sets the name of the new solid.

 

Component ( name componentname  )

Sets the name of the component for the new solid. The component must already exist.

 

Material ( name materialname )

Sets the material name for the new solid. The material must already exist.

 

Twistangle ( double twistvalue )

Sets the angle to twist the created shape around the path curve.

 

Taperangle ( double tapervalue )

Sets the angle to taper the created shape along the path curve. A negative angle will taper the shape, a positive angle will flare the shape.

 

ProjectProfileToPathAdvanced ( bool value )

If activated the profile curve is projected onto the path curve by aligning the profile curve with  the face normal defined by the path curve.

 

Path ( name pathname )

Specifies a curve item which will serve as a path for the sweep operation. The correct format for the name should be 'curvename:curveitemname' (see the example below). If the curve item (e.g. a line) is connected with an other curve item (e.g. a polygon) both curve items will be used as path.

 

Curve ( name curvename )

Specifies the curve item which will be swept along the specified path. The correct format for the name should be 'curvename:curveitemname' (see the example below). If the curve item (e.g. a line) is connected with an other curve item (e.g. a polygon) both curve items will be swept along the path.

 

Create

Creates a new solid. All necessary settings for this solid have to be made previously.

Default Settings

Material ("Vacuum")
