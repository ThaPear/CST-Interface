SAT Object

This command offers SAT file import. With this feature you can import data from any other ACIS based CAD system.

If possible use this interface for 3D data import instead of IGES / STL import, because this is the programs native format.

Methods

 

Reset

Resets the import options to the default.

 

FileName ( filename filename )

Sets the name of the imported file or the file to be exported to.

 

Id ( int id )

A CAD file may be imported more than once into the same project with different settings of import options. In order to improve the performance of structure rebuilds, an intermediate sat file is stored during the import process which allows to quickly re-read the data during rebuilds in case that the original CAD file has not been modified. The naming convention of the intermediate sat file has to be unique for each individual import step. Therefore, in case that the same file is imported more than once or a file with the same name is imported into the project, the Id setting needs to be increased. The Id will then be incorporated into the file name which ensures unique file names for every import.

 

Version ( double version )

Sets the version of the import filter, since the behavior of the import may slightly change from version to version. This setting is available for backward compatibility reasons and should ensure that later versions of the import can exactly reproduce the behavior of earlier versions. The most recent version of the import is 9.0.

 

SubProjectName2D ( filename filename )

The SAT import is also used for the import of sub-projects. This function sets the name of the 2D sub-project including the path.

 

SubProjectName3D ( filename filename )

The SAT import is also used for the import of sub-projects. This function sets the name of the 3D sub-project including the path.

 

SubProjectScaleFactor ( double factor )

Defines the scale factor of the sub-project. ( 1.0 means m, 0.1 means dm, 0.01 means cm, ... )

 

SubProjectLocalWCS ( double x, double y, double z, double nx, double ny, double nz, double ux, double uy, double uz )

Defines the local coordinate system of the sub-project. x, y and z defines the origin. nx, ny and nz defines the normal. ux, uy and uz defines the u-vector.

 

SaveVersion ( enum version )

Saves the current model as a SAT file correspondant to the specified version number. Valid versions are "1.0", "2.0", "3.0", ..., "12.0". You may also omit this setting.

 

ScaleToUnit ( bool switch )

If set to True the imported model is scaled to the currently active unit. If not activated the import feature uses the source units. In such a case, no scaling occurs.

 

ImportToActiveCoordinateSystem ( bool switch )

Import the CAD data relative to the active coordinate system.

 

ExportFromActiveCoordinateSystem( bool switch )

If an active coordinate system is enabled and this flag is set, the coordinate system is used to calculate a transformation that is applied to the geometry before exporting. Importing that file will position the geometry to the global coordinates in that way that it was positioned and oriented to the active coordinate system while exporting.

 

Curves ( bool  switch )

Identifies if curves should be imported as curves or as solids.

 

Wires ( bool  switch )

Identifies if thin and solid wires should be imported.  At the moment only used for sub-project import.

 

SolidWiresAsSolids ( bool  switch )

Identifies if solid wires should be imported as wires or as solids. At the moment only used for sub-project import, to be backward compatible to older projects.

 

Read

Starts the actual import of the file.

 

Write ( name shapeOrComponentName )

Performs the export for one shape or for all shapes of the specified component.

 

WriteAll

Exports all data.
