VectorPlot3D Object

With this object three dimensional complex vector fields can be plotted in various ways. To choose what field to plot the SelectTreeItem command can be used.

General Methods

Type ( enum key )

Selects the type of Plot.

key can have one of  the following values:

"arrows"            The field vectors will be plotted as arrows.

"cone"              The field vectors will be plotted as cones.

"thinarrows"        The field vectors will be plotted as thin arrows.

"bubble"            The field vectors will be plotted as bubble.

"hedgehog”          The field vectors will be plotted as ”lines”.

"streamline”        Stream lines (cylindrical shapes) will be used to represent the fields. (Interesting mainly for the representation of pointing vectors)

"thinstreamline”    Stream lines (line shapes) will be used to represent the fields. (Interesting mainly for the representation of pointing vectors)

 

PhaseValue ( double phase )

Specifies the phase of to be plotted complex field values.

 

PhaseStep ( double phasestep )

Specifies the step width used by phase incrementing actions.

 

SetDensityInPercent( int objects )

Specifies the relative  number of plotted objects. Default density is set to 50%. The density  should be between 0% and 100%

 

Scaling ( int scale )

Defines a scale factor of the plotted objects. A value between 0 and 100 may be given. This value influences the size of the objects.

 

ActivateStreamLines( int SeedPoints )

Specifies the number of seedpoints used to generate stream lines and activates the stream line plot.

 

SetTime ( double time )

The current time value of a time monitor plot is set.

 

SetSample ( long sample )

The current time sample number of a time monitor plot is set.

 

%% Query

 

GetDomain enum

Returns the domain of the monitor used, return code can have the following values:

"frequency"     The plot is based on recordings of a frequency domain monitor.

"time"          The plot is based on recordings of a time domain monitor.

"static"        The plot is based on recordings of a static monitor.

 

GetNumberOfSamples long

Returns the total number of samples if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.

 

GetTStart double 

Returns the start time of recording if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.0.

 

GetTEnd double  

Returns the end time of recording if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.0.

 

GetTStep double 

Returns the time step width of recording if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.0.

 

GetTime double 

Returns the current  time set of a time monitor plot.

 

GetSample long 

Returns the current time sample number of a time monitor plot.

 

AddListItem ( double x, double  y, double z)

Adds a field value query point to the internal coordinate list. Coordinates are expected in project units.

 

SetPoints(variant var_x, variant var_y, variant var_z)

Adds a field value arrays query point to the internal coordinate list. Coordinates are expected in project units.

 

CalculateList

Calculates field values at all query points provided by the AddListItem command.

 

GetListLength long 

Returns the number of field values calculated by CalculateList.

 

GetListItem( long index, double_ref FieldXRe, double_ref FieldXIm, double_ref FieldYRe, double_ref FieldYIm, double_ref FieldZRe, double_ref FieldZIm) bool 

Returns the field value at position index calculated by CalculateList.

 

GetList( string fieldComponent ) variant 

Returns the field values calculated by CalculateList as an array of doubles. Allowed values for fieldComponent are "xre", "yre", "zre", "xim", "yim", "zim".

 

GetLogarithmicFactor() double 

Returns the logarithmic factor of selected result. This factor is used .for dB scaling.

 

 

Reset

Clears the internal storage used by the field list evaluation and empties the evaluation point storage.

Example

The following script plots the electric field  "e1" (if available) in a linear scale by using  thin arrows with density 30%.

 

' Plot only a wire frame of the structure to be able to look inside

Plot.wireframe (True)

 

' Select the desired monitor in the tree.

SelectTreeItem ("2D/3D Results\E-Field\e1")

 

' Plot the field of the selected monitor

With VectorPlot3D

    .Type ("thinarrows")

    .SetDensityInPercent(30)
