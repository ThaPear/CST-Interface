Result1DComplex Object
This object offers access and manipulation functions to complex 1D results. A Result1DComplex object can hold a number of points ( x, y ) where x is a real number and y is a complex number. Access to the points is possible by specifying an zero-based index.
A typical use case for a Result1DComplex object would be to load a previously calculated S-Parameter and do some post-processing on the data.

Methods

Initialize ( string Size )

Initializes an empty Result1DComplex object with the given number of samples.

 

Load ( string FileName )

Loads a 1D Complex result from a file. The string FileName is the signal file name for the complex signal to be loaded. If you do not specify an absolute path, the path of the current project will be used. If you do not specify a file ending, the default file ending ".sig" will be used.

Note: The names used in the ResultTree do not necessarily correspond to the file names. The file names of tree items can be queried using the ResultTree Object.

 

Save ( string FileName )

Saves the object to a file with the given filename. If you do not specify an absolute path, the path of the current project will be used. If you do not specify a file ending, the default file ending ".sig" will be used.

 

LoadFromMagnitudeAndPhase ( string MagnitudeFilename , string PhaseFilename )

Loads a 1D Complex result out of two files. The string MagnitudeFilename specifies the file where the magnitude of the data is stored. The string PhaseFilename specifies the file where the phase in degree of the data is stored. If the two files have a different sampling, an error will be returned. If you do not specify an absolute path, the path of the current project will be used. If you do not specify a file ending, the default file ending ".sig" will be used.

 

LoadFromRealAndImaginary ( string RealFilename , string ImaginaryFilename )

Loads a 1D Complex result out of two files. The string RealFilename specifies the file where the real part of the data is stored. The string ImaginaryFilename specifies the file where the imaginary part of the data is stored. If the two files have a different sampling, an error will be returned. If you do not specify an absolute path, the path of the current project will be used. If you do not specify a file ending, the default file ending ".sig" will be used.

 

AddToTree ( string TreePath )

Inserts the Result1DComplex object into the tree at the folder specified by TreePath. Please note that the Result1DComplex object needs to be saved before it can be added to the tree. It will be automatically added below the "1D Results" tree folder. See also SetReferenceImpedanceLink.

SetArray ( variant doubleArray, string component )

Overwrites the data in the Result1DComplex object with the data provided as double array . The string component can be 'x', 'yre'  or 'yim' and specifies which component of the Result1DComplex object will be overwritten, analogous to 'SetX' and 'SetYRe' and 'SetYIm'. The variant doubleArray can be an array of double values. It has to start with index zero and it is expected to have at least as many elements as the Result1DComplex object contains. In case more elements are provided, they will be ignored. Consider using the methods 'GetN' to query and 'Initialize' to modify the size of the Result1DComplex object.

 

%% General Settings

 

Title ( string name )

Defines the title of the result.

 

Xlabel ( string name )

Defines the x-axis label of the result.

 

Ylabel ( string name )

Defines the y-axis label of the result.

 

GetTitle string

Returns the title label of the result. This function works only for user added tree result objects.

 

GetXlabel string

Returns the x-axis label of the result. This function works only for user added tree result objects.

 

GetYlabel string

Returns the y-axis label of the result. This function works only for user added tree result objects.

 

SetLogarithmicFactor( string LogFactor )

When the complex curve contained in the Result1DComplex object is visualized in dB, the logarithmic factor provides the scaling of the data. The string LogFactor can be 10 for a power quantity, 20 for a field quantity, or -1 which will disable the dB option. The default is 20.

 

GetLogarithmicFactor double

Returns the logarithmic factor.

 

SetReferenceImpedanceLink( string TreePath )

This command allows adding a 1D result to the Navigation Tree which can be visualized as a Smith Chart. One can specify a link to another existing 1D result in the Navigation Tree which will be interpreted as reference impedance data. The link is created when the Result1DComplex object is added to the Navigation Tree via a subsequent call of AddToTree. The reference impedance item needs to be an existing complex-valued item of the same sampling as the processed data. It also needs to be located within the same Navigation Tree folder as the reference impedance tree item, otherwise AddToTree will report an error. See also Examples.

 

GetReferenceImpedanceLink string

Returns the tree item specified by SetReferenceImpedanceLink.

 

SetDefaultPlotView( string Type  )

This setting specifies the default plot view type that should be used when a 1D plot of  this result is opened. The variable Type specifies the type of view that should be plotted and can be one of the following strings: "real", "imaginary", "magnitude", "magnitudedb", "phase", "polar", or an empty string. This setting is considered if the Result1DComplex object is created and processed within a template evaluation in the Template Based Post-Processing framework or if the object is added to the Navigation Tree via AddToTree.

 

GetDefaultPlotView string

Returns the default plot view type specified by SetDefaultPlotView.

 

GetResultObjectType string

Returns the string "1DC". This method can be used to distinguish the result object from Result0D and Result1D objects in a context where the type of a result object is unknown.

 

DeleteAt( string Lifetime )

This setting specifies the lifetime of the Result1DComplex object. The variable Lifetime can be one of the following strings: "never", "solverstart" or "rebuild". This setting is considered if the Result1DComplex object is added to the Navigation Tree via AddToTree.

Examples

Construction

An Result1DComplex object can be created as follows:

Dim result As Object

Set result = Result1DComplex("")

 

This will create an empty object. Alternatively, a filename of a complex .sig-file can be given as a parameter, then the object loads the data from the .sig-file (see Examples).


This example creates an empty object, fills it with data and adds it to the ResultTree.

 

Dim result As Object

Set result = Result1DComplex("")

With result

    .AppendXY(1,1,1)

    .AppendXY(2,2,1)

    .AppendXY(3,2,2)

    .Title("A complex curve")

    .Save("a_file_name")

    .AddToTree("1D Results\Test\complex_curve")

End With

 

This example loads the data of a complex  S-Parameter and adds it to the ResultTree.

Dim sFile As String

sFile = Resulttree.GetFileFromTreeItem("1D Results\S-Parameters\S1,1")

Dim result As Object

Set result = Result1DComplex(sFile)

result.Save("copied_s11")

result.AddToTree("1D Results\Copied Data\S1,1")

 

This example links two objects via the command SetReferenceImpedanceLink.

Dim refImp As Object

Set refImp = Result1DComplex("")

refImp.Appendxy(1,50,0)

refImp.Save("refimp_name.sig")

refImp.AddToTree("1D Results\Data\result-ref-imp")

 

Dim result As Object

Set result = Result1DComplex("")

result.Appendxy(1,0.4,0.6)

result.Save("result_name.sig")

result.SetReferenceImpedanceLink("1D Results\Data\result-ref-imp")

result.AddToTree("1D Results\Data\result")
