Polygon Object

This object is used to create a new polygon curve item.

Methods

Example

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Name ( name polygonname )

Sets the name of the polygon.

 

Curve ( name curvename  )

Sets the name of the curve for the new polygon curve item. The curve must already exist.

 

Point ( double xCoord, double yCoord )

Sets the coordinates for the first point of the polygon to be defined.

 

LineTo ( double xCoord, double yCoord )

Sets a line from the point previously defined to the point defined by x, y here. x and y specify a location in absolute coordinates in the actual working coordinate system.

 

RLine ( double xCoord, double yCoord )

Sets a line from the point previously defined to the point defined by x, y here. x and y specify a location relative to the previous point in the current working coordinate system.

 

Create

Creates a new polygon curve item. All necessary settings for this polygon have to be made previously.

Example

With Polygon

     .Reset

     .Name "polygon1"

     .LineTo "-5.4", "-1.2"

     .LineTo "-0.2", "a+6.5"

     .RLine "5.3", "-0.6"

     .LineTo "8.3", "5.3"

     .Create
