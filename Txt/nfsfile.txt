NFSFile Object

The NFS file format allows the imprint of equivalent surface fields on a box or even on single planes. This format is especially designed for scan data and is able to handle an equidistant as well as a non-equidistant sampled spatial distribution of field data.

The format is based on the IEC® Technical Report IEC/TR 61967-1-1.

 

In order to describe surface fields on a rectangular box surface, each face and field component has to be defined  in a single XML-file and a corresponding DAT-file.

The XML-file contains all meta-data such as field type, field components (Ex, Ey, Ez, Hx, Hy, Hz ), frequencies, and a reference to the DAT-file.

The DAT-file contains the actual field data values in the following ASCII pattern:

 

x0 y0 z0 Re(freq1) Im(freq1) Re(freq2) Im(freq2) Re(freq3) Im(freq3) ...

x1 y0 z0 Re(freq1) Im(freq1) Re(freq2) Im(freq2) Re(freq3) Im(freq3) ...

x0 y1 z0 Re(freq1) Im(freq1) Re(freq2) Im(freq2) Re(freq3) Im(freq3) ...

...

 

Where (x_i, y_i, z_i) describe point positions of a cartesian grid and Re(freq1) / Im(freq2) the real / imaginary part of the field value at frequency freq1 and position (x_i, y_i, z_i). Example files for the supported types of the NFS format for the CST MICROWAVE STUDIO transient solver can be found here. A detailed description of the file syntax can be found in  IEC® Technical Report IEC/TR 61967-1-1.

Methods

Reset

Resets the import options to the default.

 

SetCoarsening ( double coarseningFactor )

Set the coarsening of the hexaedral mesh that will be generated to export the field monitor data. The factor sets the density of the output mesh in relation to the existing mesh, that can be inspected with  "Home -> Mesh -> Mesh View". For example, a factor of 2 leads to a mesh which is 2 times coarser than the original mesh.

 

SetInteractive ( bool Interactive )

Set to true, will ask for user interaction when something unexpected happens, e.g. if a folder has to be deleted before exporting. Otherwise will abort.

 

DeleteFolderIfPresent ( bool DeleteFolderIfPresent )

Set this option to True to delete an existing folder when exporting without prompting. Only works in non-interactive mode.

 

SetOutputFolder ( filename NFSDirectoryPath )

Sets the output directory path where the NFS files should be located.

 

Export ( string MonitorName, string ExcitationString )

Export the specified field source monitor of the excitation in the current project.

 

Write ( filename FSMFile,  filename NFSDirectoryPath )

Converts FSM-file to NFS-files, that will be saved in the specified directory. An absolute path has to be specified.

Default Settings

SetOutputFolder ("<Path to FSM-file>\<FSM-filename without file-ending (.fsm)>\")

SetCoarsening (1)

SetInteractive (True)

DeleteFolderIfPresent (False)

Examples

' Convert an FSM-file by directly specifying the filename and output folder

NFSFile.Write("C:\Path\To\Some\Monitorfile.fsm", "C:\Output")

 

' Export the monitor named "my_monitor" with excitation string "1" to the path "C:\nfs-export\".

' Set the mesh half as dense as the mesh on the field source monitor surface.

With NFSFile

    .Reset

    .SetCoarsening (2)

    .SetOutputFolder ("C:\nfs-export")

    .Export ("my_monitor", "1")
