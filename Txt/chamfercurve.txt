ChamferCurve Object

This object enables a chamfer operation on a curve item. The edge produced by two segments of the item will be cut to the specified width. If the width is chosen in a way that the structure would change significantly, the operation might not be possible. The chamfer operation will then modify the curve items connected to the selected point and create a new item which actually represents the chamfer. The chamfer item can be identified by an unique name, e.g. for subsequent editing operations.

As soon as the chamfer is defined it will appear in the main plot window and on the Navigation Tree.

Methods

Example

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Name ( name chamfername )

Sets the name of the new chamfer item.

 

Width ( double widthvalue )

Specify a valid expression for the width of the chamfer.

 

Curve ( name curvename )

Specifies the curve the new created chamfer item object will belong to.

 

CurveItem1 ( name curveitemname )

Selects a specified curve item which has to belong to the same curve object as curve item No.2.

 

CurveItem2 ( name curveitemname )

Selects a specified curve item which has to belong to the same curve object as curve item No.1.

 

EdgeId1 ( int edgeid1 )

Defines a specified edge of a curve item by its identity number.

 

EdgeId2 ( int edgeid2 )

Defines a specified edge of a curve item by its identity number.

 

VertexId1 ( int vertexid1 )

Defines a specified vertex of a curve item by its identity number.

 

VertexId2 ( int vertexid2 )

Defines a specified vertex of a curve item by its identity number.

 

Create

Creates a new curve item. All necessary settings for it have to be made previously.
