WakefieldPostprocessor Object
This Object is used to compute secondary results from previously computed wake-functions.

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Resultname (name  name )

Name for the new post-processing result.

 

UseFFT (bool, flag)

Allows to use a FFT instead of a DFT for the fourier transformation of the wake signals. The FFT is much faster but less flexible than the DFT.

 

ParticleBeam (name  name )

Selects a wake-function for a certain particle beam source.

 

Fmin (double  value)

Sets the minimum frequency value for a wake-impedance spectrum calculation. Only active if UseFFT is set to "False".

 

Fmax (double  value)

Sets the maximum frequency value for a wake-impedance spectrum calculation. Only active if UseFFT is set to "False".

 

FrequencySteps (int  steps)

Sets the number of frequency samples for a wake-impedance calculation. Only active if UseFFT is set to "False".

 

Filter (enum  type)

Sets the type of pre-filtering for a wake impedance calculation. Currently "None" and "Cos2" is available.

 

FilterParameter (int  parameterindex, double  value)

Sets the filter parameters for a certain type of pre-filter.

  

Filtertype  Parameters

None        ---

Cos2        #1: The rolloff-factor with a range from 0 to 1.

Note: The parameter-index must be equal or larger than one.

 

Calculate (enum  calculationtype)

Sets the type of the wake post-processing step. Currently only "ImpedanceSpectrum" is available.
