ScalarPlot2D Object

This object allows to plot three dimensional vector fields on a cutting plane. Therefore the 3D Fields on 2D Plane option has to be active. To choose what field to plot, the SelectTreeItem command can be used.

General Methods

Type ( enum key )

Selects the type of Plot.

key can have one of  the following values:

"contour"       The field values of the chosen scalar field will be plotted on the chosen cutting plane in different colors.

"isoline"       Lines of equal value of the chosen scalar field will be plotted on the chosen cutting plane.

"carpet"        Plots a carpet or a surface where the distance of a point on the cutting plane to the surface represents the field value at this point.

"carpetcolor"   The same as ”carpet”, but additionally it is colored in relation to the field values.

 

PlotAmplitude ( bool switch )

If switch is True, the absolute values (the amplitudes) of the complex scalar values are plotted.

 

PhaseValue ( double phase )

Specifies the phase of to be plotted complex field values.

 

PhaseStep ( double step )

Specifies the step width used by phase incrementing actions.

 

Quality ( int quality )

The Plot data for scalar values on surfaces is represented by triangles. This setting influences the number of triangles used for the plot. A fine plot quality will result in a longer plot generation time and thus in slower movies as well. A value between 0 and 100 may be given.

 

Transparency ( double transparency )

Sets the transparency for drawing contour plots or carpet plots. The transparency value is a floating point number in the range from 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 0.0 means that the field visualization is drawn opaquely whereas a value of 1.0 indicates that the field data is drawn completely transparent (invisible).

 

PlaneNormal ( enum normal )

Sets the direction of the cutting plane where the fields are to be plotted. The position of the plane can be set by PlaneCoordinate.

normal can have one of  the following values:

"x"     x  is the coordinate direction of the cutting plane.

"y"     y  is the coordinate direction of the cutting plane.

"z"     z  is the coordinate direction of the cutting plane.

 

PlaneCoordinate ( double position )

Sets the position of the cutting plane where the fields are to be plotted. The direction of the plane can be set by PlaneNormal.

 

SetTime ( double time )

The current time value of a time monitor plot is set.

 

SetSample ( long sample )

The current time sample number of a time monitor plot is set.

 

SetComponent ( enum component )

Sets the vector component of a vector result that should be visualized by a Scalar Plot.

component can have one of  the following values:

"x"             The x component of the vector result

"y"             The y component of the vector result

"z"             The z component of the vector result

"abs"           The absolute value of the vector result

"normal"        The normal part of the vector field is the scalar product of the surface’s normal vector and the field vector on the surface.

"tangential"    The tangential part is the absolute value of the difference between the vector and the normal part of the vector.

 

%% Query

 

GetDomain enum

Returns the domain of the monitor used, return code can have the following values:

"frequency"     The plot is based on recordings of a frequency domain monitor.

"time"          The plot is based on recordings of a time domain monitor.

"static"        The plot is based on recordings of a static monitor.

 

GetNumberOfSamples long

Returns the total number of samples if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.

 

GetTStart double

Returns the start time of recording if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.0.

 

GetTEnd double

Returns the end time of recording if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.0.

 

GetTStep double

Returns the time step width of recording if the plot is based on recordings of a time monitor else 0.0.

 

GetTime double

Returns the current  time set of a time monitor plot.

 

GetSample long

Returns the current time sample number of a time monitor plot.
