Methods

Reset

Resets the import options to the default.

 

Name ( name name )

Sets the name for the newly imported shape.

 

Id ( int id )

A CAD file may be imported more than once into the same project with different settings of import options. In order to improve the performance of structure rebuilds, an intermediate sat file is stored during the import process which allows to quickly re-read the data during rebuilds in case that the original CAD file has not been modified. The naming convention of the intermediate sat file has to be unique for each individual import step. Therefore, in case that the same file is imported more than once or a file with the same name is imported into the project, the Id setting needs to be increased. The Id will then be incorporated into the file name which ensures unique file names for every import.

 

Layer ( name layername )

Sets the layer for the new shape. The component and the material are chosen according to the specified layer.

 

FileName ( filename filename )

Sets the name of the imported file.

 

Healing ( bool switch )

If set to True, the geometry is automatically repaired during the import.

 

ScaleToUnit ( bool switch )

If set to True the imported model is scaled to the currently active unit. If not activated the import feature uses the source units. In such a case, no scaling occurs.

 

ImportToActiveCoordinateSystem ( bool switch )

Import the CAD data relative to the active coordinate system.

 

Curves ( bool  switch )

Identifies if curves should be imported as curves or as solids.

 

Read

Starts the actual import of the file.

Default Settings
