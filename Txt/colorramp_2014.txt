ColorRamp Object
Use this to change the color order for the color-by-value field plots.

Methods

Scaling ( enum scaletype )

Stretches or squeezes the color ramp.

enum scaletype  meaning                                                             result for rainbow type

"None"          The color ramp is neither squeezed nor stretched.                   blue-cyan-green-yellow-red

"Stretch"       The range 0..max is stretched to -max..max.                         green-yellow-red

"Squeeze"       The range -max..max is squeezed to 0..max and inverted to -max..0.  red-yellow-green-cyan-blue-cyan-green-yellow-red

 

AddPoint ( double value, double red, double green, double blue )

A user defined color ramp is shown for .Type "Free". For any field value in the range from -1 (minimum) to +1 (maximum), the desired color can be defined by three doubles ranging from 0 to 1. The color values between two adjacent points will be interpolated. At least two color definitions are needed. See Example.

 

Style (enum style{"None" / "Horizontal" / "Vertical"} )

This switch either hides (None) the color ramp or positions it horizontally or vertically in the main view.

Default Settings

Type ("rainbow")
