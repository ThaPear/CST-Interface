ColorRamp Object
Use this to change the color order for the color-by-value field plots.

Methods

AddFreeRampVertex ( double value, double red, double green, double blue )
Adds a vertex to the user-defined color ramp. All parameters need to be in the range [0.0, 1.0]. The value defines the relative position on the color ramp, with value = 0.0 referring to the lower bound of the color ramp and value = 1.0 to the upper bound. The color given in red, green, blue is interpolated linearly between the given color ramp vertices.
For example a simple color ramp ranging from red to white is defined as follows:
AddFreeRampVertex (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
AddFreeRampVertex (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
 
DeleteFreeRampVertices
Delete all vertices from the user-defined color ramp. This results in an empty black user-defined color ramp.
