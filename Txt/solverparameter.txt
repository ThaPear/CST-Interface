SolverParameter Object
This object controls the model simplification settings for a specific solver.

 

Methods

SolverType ( enum solverkey, enum meshkey )

The settings below apply to the solver which is specified by the solverkey:

"Transient solver"

"Frequency domain solver"

"Asymptotic solver"

"Eigenmode solver"

"Electrostatics solver"

"Magnetostatic solver"

"LF Frequency domain solver"

"LF Frequency domain solver (EQS)"

"Stationary current solver"

"Particle tracking solver"

"PIC solver"

"Thermal solver"

"Integral equation solver"

"Multilayer solver"

"LF Time domain solver (MQS)"

"LF Time domain solver (EQS)"

"Thermal transient solver"

 "Structural mechanics solver"

"Wakefield solver"

The following values are allowed for the meshkey:

"Hexahedral"

"Tetrahedral"

"Surface"

 

IgnoreLossyMetals ( bool flag  )

Do not consider losses of metal materials during a simulation run.

 

IgnoreLossyDielectrics ( bool flag  )

Do not consider losses of normal materials during a simulation run.

 

IgnoreLossyMetalsForWires ( bool flag  )

Neglect losses of metal materials for wires during a simulation run.

 

IgnoreNonlinearMaterials ( bool flag  )

Neglect nonlinear material settings and simulate all materials as linear (normal).

 

UseThinWireModel ( bool flag  )

Use infinite thin wires mapped to the mesh during a simulation run.

UseZeroWireRadius (bool flag  )

Do not consider a radius greater zero wires during a simulation run.

Default Settings
