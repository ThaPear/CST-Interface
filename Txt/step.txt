STEP Object

Methods

Reset

Resets the import options to the default.

 

FileName ( filename filename )

Sets the name of the imported file or the file to be exported to.

 

Id ( int id )

A CAD file may be imported more than once into the same project with different settings of import options. In order to improve the performance of structure rebuilds, an intermediate sat file is stored during the import process which allows to quickly re-read the data during rebuilds in case that the original CAD file has not been modified. The naming convention of the intermediate sat file has to be unique for each individual import step. Therefore, in case that the same file is imported more than once or a file with the same name is imported into the project, the Id setting needs to be increased. The Id will then be incorporated into the file name which ensures unique file names for every import.

 

Version ( double version )

Sets the version of the import filter, since the behavior of the import may slightly change from version to version. This setting is available for backward compatibility reasons and should ensure that later versions of the import can exactly reproduce the behavior of earlier versions. The most recent version of the import is 11.0.

 

Healing ( bool switch )

If set to True structure will be healed after it is imported. Healing checks the imported structure and tries to repair it, if necessary.

 

ScaleToUnit ( bool switch )

If set to True the imported model is scaled to the currently active unit. If not activated the import feature uses the source units. In such a case, no scaling occurs.

 

ImportToActiveCoordinateSystem ( bool switch )

Import the CAD data relative to the active coordinate system.

 

ExportFromActiveCoordinateSystem( bool switch )

If an active coordinate system is enabled and this flag is set, the coordinate system is used to calculate a transformation that is applied to the geometry before exporting. Importing that file will position the geometry to the global coordinates in that way that it was positioned and oriented to the active coordinate system while exporting.

 

Curves ( bool  switch )

If set to True curves will be imported from the import file.

 

ImportAttributes ( bool  switch )

Identifies if attributes like solid names, material names and material color should be read from the import file.

 

ImportCurveAttributes ( bool  switch )

Identifies if the attributes like curve names should be read from the import file.

 

ExportAttributes ( bool  switch )

Identifies if attributes like curve names, solid names, material names and material color should be written to the export file.

 

Read

Starts the actual import of the file.

 

Write

Performs the export.

 

WriteAll

Exports all data.
