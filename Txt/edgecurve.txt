EdgeCurve Object

This object enables the creation of a new curve item from previously picked edges. The newly created item will become a copy of the picked edges. A new item will be assigned to a previously defined curve. Thus the corresponding menu or toolbar items will only be active if at least one curve has been defined before (Modeling: Curves > Curves  ) and an edge has been previously picked from within the structure.

Within its curve each item is identified by an unique name. The curve item can be addressed by this name for subsequent editing operations.

As soon as the curve item is defined it will appear in the main plot window and on the Navigation Tree.

Curve ( name curvename )

Specifies the curve to which the new curve item will belong to.

 

AddEdge ( solidname solidname, int edgeid)
