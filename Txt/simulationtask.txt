Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Type ( string type )

Sets the type for a simulation task. This setting must be made before calling Create. The type can not be modified after the creation. Most task settings can be accessed by a simulation task object. In addition, specialized objects are available for some types of tasks. Valid task types and specialized objects are:

"spectral lines"

"mixer"

"amplifier"

"transient"

"template"

"sequence"

"array"

Name ( name taskname )

Sets the name of a simulation task before calling Create. Furthermore, this method can be used to select an existing task of your project. The task name needs to include all parent tasks for nested tasks, separated by backslashes, e.g. "Seq1\SPara1".

 

Create

Creates a new simulation task.

 

Delete

Deletes the task with the given name. Name needs to be called before this function can be evaluated.

 

Update

Executes the task with the given name, including all sub tasks. Name needs to be called before this function can be evaluated.

Note: To update all Tasks in the tree, the command  "UpdateResults" can be used. This command is not part of the object SimulationTask.

 

SetName ( name taskname )

Modifies the name of an existing simulation task. The name needs to include parent tasks, like for Name. By specifying a different parent part it is also possible to move a task from one parent to another.

 

MoveInTree ( name newparent, name nexttask )

Moves an existing simulation task to a different position in the tree. newparent specifies the new parent task (including parents of the parent like for Name). If newparent is empty the task will be moved to the top level. If nexttask is empty the task will be moved behind all tasks at the new level. If nexttask is not empty the task will be moved in front of nexttask. nexttask specifies the task name only (without parent tasks).
