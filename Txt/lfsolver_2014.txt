SetLFPreconditionerAcceleration (enum precondtype)

Specifies the preconditioner used to solve linear systems of equations. Available options are:
                    
precondtype (enum ) meaning

"Auto"              The preconditioner type is chosen automatically. Currently the Low Memory type will be used by default, but this might change with future versions.

"Accelerated"       A preconditioner which is suited well for structures with high mesh- and material-ratios. This method is more memory consuming, but might converge in situations where the Low Memory type does not converge.

"Low Memory"        This preconditioner type is very memory efficient and converges if mesh- and material- ratios are not very high.


Default Settings

Accuracy "1e-6"

Preconditioner "ILU"

UseFullWaveCalculation "False"

LSESolverType  "Auto"

MeshAdaption "False"

StoreResultsInCache "False"

ValueScaling "Peak"

UseMaxNumberOfThreads "False"

MaxNumberOfThreads "8"
