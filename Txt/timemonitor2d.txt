TimeMonitor2D Object

Defines a functional monitor which evaluates a field on a specified set of connected faces.  

Methods

Default Settings

Examples

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal values to their default settings.

 

Name ( name monitorName )

Sets the name of the monitor.

 

Rename ( name oldName, name newName )

Renames the monitor named oldName to newName.

 

Delete ( name monitorName )

Deletes the monitor named monitorName.

 

Create

Creates the monitor with the previously applied settings.

 

FieldType ( enum fType )

Sets what field is to be monitored.

 

fType can have one of the following values:

”current”           The current flow through the prescribed faces will be monitored.

"magnetic flux"     The magnetix flux through the prescribed faces will be monitored.

 

UsePickedFaceFromId ( string shapeName, int face_id )

For consistency reasons you need to specify the faces to be used by a solid to which it belongs (shapeName), and identification number of the face (face_id). These values can be obtained from the Pick Object command PickFaceFromId.

To define a valid monitor, the chain of faces must be connected.

 

InvertOrientation ( bool bFlag )

The orientation of the first edge or curve in a chain specifies a direction which influences the result when the monitor is evaluated along this chain. If bFlag is True, this orientation (direction) is inverted.

Default Settings

InvertOrientation (False)
