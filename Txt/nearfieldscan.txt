NearfieldScan Object
The cylinder scan calculates electrical field values on parametrized cylinder outside the simulation volume. A proper farfield monitor has to be defined before starting the simulation to allow the cylinder scan calculation as a post-processing step.

Methods

Default Settings

Example

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal values to their default settings.

 

FarfieldMonitor ( name sName )

Defines the farfield monitor used for the cylinder scan calculation.

 

Frequency ( double frequency  )

Specifies the frequency point use for the cylinder  scan evaluation. Available for broadband farfield monitors only.

 

UserBase ( double x , double y , double z )

Base of the scan cylinder in project units.

 

Useraxis ( double x , double y , double z )

Alignment axis of the scan cylinder.

 

Step ( double step )

Specifies the angular resolution of the scan cylinder in degrees.

 

Radius ( double weight )

Specifies the radius in meters of the scan cylinder

 

Height ( double height )

Specifies the height in meters of the scan cylinder.

 

Label ( name sName )

Sets the label for the cylinder scan files and tree entry. The label is automatically created from the farfield monitor name if an empty string is set.

 

StoreSettings

Saves all previously defined cylinder scan settings.

 

Create

Executes the cylinder scan calculation using the previously defined settings.
