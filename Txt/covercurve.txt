CoverCurve Object

This object is used to cover a planar curve with a sheet in order to create a shape from a curve. The created shape is a single face and thus not a valid solid. Constraint: The curve must be closed and planar.

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Name ( name solidname )

Sets the name of the new sheet solid.

 

Component ( name componentname )

Sets the name of the component for the new sheet solid. The component must already exist.

 

Material ( name materialname )

Sets the material name for the new sheet solid. The material must already exist.

 

Curve ( name curvename )

The name of the curve item the new solid should be created. The correct format for the name should be 'curvename:curveitemname' (see the example below). If the curve item (e.g. a line) is connected with an other curve item (e.g. a polygon) both curve items will be transformed into the new sheet solid.

 

Create

Creates a new sheet solid. All necessary settings for this sheet solid have to be made previously.

Default Settings

Material ("Vacuum")
