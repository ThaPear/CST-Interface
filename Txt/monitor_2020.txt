Monitor Object

Defines 3D or 2D field monitors. Each monitor stores the field values either for a specified frequency or for a set of time samples. There are different kinds of monitors: magnetic and electric field or energy monitors as well as farfield, power flow and current monitors.

Methods
 
EnableNearfieldCalculation ( bool bFlag )
If bFlag is true, then the computation with this farfield monitor keeps the recorded nearfield data from the solver and makes sure that this data is combined in later post-processing steps that involve this monitor. This is required for some post-processing features but it potentially reduces the speed of subsequent "combine results" post-processing.
