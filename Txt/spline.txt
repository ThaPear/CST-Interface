Spline Object

This object is used to create a new spline curve item.

Methods

Example

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Name ( name splinename )

Sets the name of the spline curve.

 

Curve ( name curvename  )

Sets the name of the curve for the new spline curve item. The curve must already exist.

 

Point ( double xCoord, double yCoord )

Sets the coordinates for the first point of the spline to be defined.

 

LineTo ( double xCoord, double yCoord )

Sets a line from the point previously defined to the point defined by x, y here. x and y specify a location in absolute coordinates in the actual working coordinate system.

 

RLine ( double xCoord, double yCoord )

Sets a line from the point previously defined to the point defined by x, y here. x and y specify a location relative to the previous point in the current working coordinate system.

 

Create

Creates a new spline curve item. All necessary settings for this spline have to be made previously.

Example
