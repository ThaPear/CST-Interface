Methods

Reset

Resets all internal values to their default settings.

 

Name ( name monitorName )

Sets the name of the monitor.

 

Tstart ( double startTime )

Sets starting time for a time domain monitor to startTime.

 

Tstep ( double timeStep )

Sets the time increment for a time domain monitor to timeStep.

 

Tend ( double stopTime )

Sets the end time for a time domain monitor to stopTime.

 

UseTend ( bool bFlag )

If bFlag is True the time domain monitor stops storing the results when the end time that is set with Tend is reached. Otherwise the monitor will continue until the simulation stops.

 

Delete ( name monitorName )

Deletes the monitor named monitorName.

 

Rename ( name oldname,  name newname )

Renames the monitor named oldname to newname.

 

Create

Creates the monitor with the previously applied settings.

 

%% Queries
