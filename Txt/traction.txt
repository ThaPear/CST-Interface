Methods

Reset

Resets the default values.

 

Name ( name  name )

Sets the name of the new traction boundary.

 

Value ( double  valueX,  double  valueY,  double  valueZ )

Sets the components of the traction in a cartesian coordinate system.

 

NormalValue ( double  value )

Sets the components of the traction oriented normally to a body's surface.

 

UseValue ( bool useX,  bool useY,  bool useZ )

Allows to deactivate certain components of the traction definition, so that these deactivated components are not fixed anymore.

 

AddFace ( solidname  solidname, int  faceid )

Adds a face from a solid by its face id, where the source is mapped to.

 

Create

Creates the source with the previously made settings.

 

Delete ( name  name)

Deletes the specified traction boundary.

 

Rename ( name  oldname, name  newname )

Renames the specified traction boundary.
