Methods

Reset

Resets the import options to the default.

 

FileName ( filename filename )

Sets the name of the imported file. File can represent either a part  (file extension: par) or a sheet metal part (file extension: psm) or an assembly (file extension: asm).

 

Id ( int id )

A CAD file may be imported more than once into the same project with different settings of import options. In order to improve the performance of structure rebuilds, an intermediate sat file is stored during the import process which allows to quickly re-read the data during rebuilds in case that the original CAD file has not been modified. The naming convention of the intermediate sat file has to be unique for each individual import step. Therefore, in case that the same file is imported more than once or a file with the same name is imported into the project, the Id setting needs to be increased. The Id will then be incorporated into the file name which ensures unique file names for every import.

 

Healing ( bool switch )

If set to True structure will be healed after it is imported. Healing checks the imported structure and tries to repair it, if necessary.

 

ScaleToUnit ( bool switch )

If set to True the imported model is scaled to the currently active unit. If not activated the import feature uses the source units. In such a case, no scaling occurs.

 

Curves ( bool  switch )

If set to True curves will be imported from the import file.

 

ImportAttributes ( bool  switch )

If set to True solid names, material names and material color will be read from the import file.

 

ImportCurveAttributes ( bool  switch )

If set to True curve names will be read from the import file.

 

 

Read

Starts the actual import of the file.
