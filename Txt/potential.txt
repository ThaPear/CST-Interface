Potential Object

Defines a new potential on a PEC solid or sheet.

Methods

Reset

Resets all internal settings to their default values.

 

Name (name  name )

Sets the name of the new potential source.

 

Value (double  potentialvalue )

Sets  the potential value for a PEC solid which is specified by the face command.

 

Phase (double  phasevalue )

Sets  the phase value for a potential on a PEC solid. This setting is only considered when an electroquasistatic simulation is performed.

 

AddFace (solidname  solidname, int  faceid )

Selects a face from a solid by its face id, where the source is mapped to.

 

Type ( enum {"Fixed", "Floating"} type )

Specifies the type of the potential. If a perfect electric conductor (PEC) unit has to be maintained at a specific potential, then set the potential type to "Fixed". Alternatively, the PEC unit can be made "Floating" meaning that this the corresponding unit has a constant charge..

 

Create

Creates the source with the previously made settings.

 

Delete (name  name)

Deletes the specified potential source.

 

Rename (name  oldname, name  newname )

Renames the specified potential.

 

GetType (name name ) type

Returns the type ("Fixed" or "Floating") of a potential source with a given name.

 

GetValue (name name ) potentialvalue

Returns the value of a potential source with a given name.

 

GetPhase (name name ) phasevalue

Returns the phase of a potential source with a given name.

Default Settings

Value ("0")

Face ("", 0)

Example

With Potential

     .Reset

     .Name ("potential1")

     .Value ("1")

     .Phase ("0")

     .Face ("component1:solid1", "1")

     .Type ("Fixed")

     .Create
