ColourMapPlot Object

This object allows controlling the visualization of color map plots.

 

Methods

Reset

Reset all plot options to their default values.

 

PlotView( string type ) bool

This method corresponds to selecting a certain plot of the plot toolbar. The variable type specifies the type of view that should be plotted and can be one of the following strings: "real", "imaginary", "magnitude", "magnitudedb", "phase". If the data could be plotted with the given view type, the method returns true, otherwise false.

 

SetXTicks( long nticks)

Specifies the number of ticks along the horizontal axis. Please note that at least two ticks must be specified.

 

SetYTicks( long nticks)

Specifies the number of ticks along the vertical axis. Please note that at least two ticks must be specified.

 

SetDrawGrid ( bool grid)

This option specifies whether a grid is drawn on top of the data.

 

SetClampToRange( bool clamp)

This option specifies whether the color ramp is scaled to the maximum data range or to a custom lower and upper limit. If this setting is turned on, the color ramp limits are specified by the SetClampToRangeMin and SetClampToRangeMax settings.

 

SetClampToRangeMin( double limit )

This option is used only if the SetClampToRange option is turned on. The limit specifies the lower bound of the color ramp scale.

 

SetClampToRangeMax( double limit )

This option is used only if the SetClampToRange option is turned on. The limit specifies the upper bound of the color ramp scale.

 

SetSkipLessThan ( bool skip)

This option specifies whether data values below a given threshold shall be skipped from visualization. The threshold value is specified by the SetSkipLessThanValue setting.

 

SetSkipLessThanValue( double threshold)

This option is used only if the SetSkipLessThan option is turned on. The limit specifies the threshold such that data values below this limit will be skipped from visualization.

 

GetXMinData double

Get the x and y ranges of the data.

 

GetXMaxData double

Get the x and y ranges of the data.

 

GetYMinData double

Get the x and y ranges of the data.

 

GetYMaxData double

Get the x and y ranges of the data.

 

GetXMinView double

Get the x and y ranges of the current view.

 

GetXMaxView double

Get the x and y ranges of the current view.

 

GetYMinView double

Get the x and y ranges of the current view.

 

GetYMaxView double

Get the x and y ranges of the current view.

 

GetDataMinValue double

Get the minimum and maximum values of the data.

 

GetDataMaxValue double

Get the minimum and maximum values of the data.

 

GetViewMinValue double

Get the minimum and maximum values of the subset of the data which is currently displayed in the view.

 

GetViewMaxValue double

Get the minimum and maximum values of the subset of the data which is currently displayed in the view.

 

GetDataNx  long

Get the number of data samples along the x and y axes.

 

GetDataNy long

Get the number of data samples along the x and y axes.

 

GetDataValue (  long x, long y ) double

Get the value of the data with the given indices x and y. Valid indices are greater or equal 0 and lower than the number of data samples in the corresponding direction.
